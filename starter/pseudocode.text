Display the Current Day and Time
    Use JavaScript to get the current date and time using the Date object or a library like dayjs.
    Update the #currentDay and #time-display elements with the current day and time

 Generate Timeblocks for Standard Business Hours:
    Use JavaScript to dynamically generate timeblocks for standard business hours (e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM) within the container element in the HTML.
    You can use a loop to create HTML elements representing each timeblock

Color-Code Timeblocks Based on Past, Present, and Future
    Compare the current time with the time represented by each timeblock to determine if it's in the past, present, or future.
    Apply appropriate CSS classes to color-code the timeblocks based on their time status.

Allow Users to Enter Events:
    Add event listeners to the timeblocks to allow users to click and enter events.
    You can use modal dialogs, input fields, or any other UI element to capture the event details.

Save Events in Local Storage:
    When a user enters an event and clicks a save button, use JavaScript to save the event details in local storage.
    You can use the localStorage API to store and retrieve event data.
    
Persist Events Between Page Refreshes:
Upon page load, retrieve the event data from local storage and populate the timeblocks with any saved events.
